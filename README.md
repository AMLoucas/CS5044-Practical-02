# CS5044-Practical-02
CS5044 was a module in my MSc with the course title 'Information Visualisation'. This project was my second practical.
Myself and Alun (pair project) had to identify data and a suitable open ended question. Once the we identified the data and the question we would tackle we had to create a web-based visualisation using D3 and javascript libraries. Tasks done in the project:
 
 * Explore datasets and different open-ended questions
 * Apply an iteration ideation process to brainstorm ideas
 * Implement final idea from ideation process in D3.js
 * Sum up all the process and the ideation flow in a report.

All files can be found in the repo.
The module's objective outline was to introduce us to information visualisation principles and introducing to visualisaton programming languages like D3.js and Desktop Tableau.
