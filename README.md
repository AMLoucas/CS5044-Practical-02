Information Visualisation is used to answer an open ended question. Data that will be used is from Kaggle.
We will explore data that holds the top 250 football transfers from every season. The data is recorded from 2000-2001(Season) until 2018-2019(Season).
We want to view how the distribution of the transfer market has changed over the year.

 * From which league does each league buy from?
 * How has the prices changed over the years?
 * Does the players position or age play a role in the transfer price?
 * etc.
