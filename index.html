					<h3>About Transfer Market Analytics</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						The football transfer market has transformed and changed over the years.
						With the help of visualisation we will be exploring the following question:
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						•	How do the top 5 league transfer spending’s compare with each other over the seasons
						and what players positions are mostly involved in these transfers?
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Together with the visualisation techniques we will use data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information
						on the 250 most expensive transfers from each past season. From this data we filtered out and obtained only data that concerns the
						top 5 football leagues.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						You can visit the 'Analytics' tab to start exploring. For the tutorial you can preview the video provided, which provides
						instructions on how the different visuals are used to obtain insights. In addition to this the report is an extra manual
						on how the visuals are used.
